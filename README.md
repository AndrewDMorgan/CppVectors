# C++ Vectors And More

CVectors contains a vector3 type called float3 and multiple math functions such as a cross prduct. The vector type overloads multiple operators including comparison operators ("==", "!=", ">", ect...) allowing for math between float3's and floats. The math functions are as following, ceil, floor, abs, ect..., dot for 1 - 2 vectors, normalize, cross, round, length for 1 - 2 vectors, map (remaps the range and is for vectors and floats), pow, clamp (vectors and floats), clamp01 (vectors and floats), lerp (vectors and floats), smoothstep (vectors and floats), min (vectors and floats), max (vectors and floats), fract (vectors and floats), print (prints the xyz of the vector and is for debugging).

# How To Use

To use the functions and types in CVectors, you want to include the header file: #include "CVectors". After that, you will have acces to all the functions and types. Ensure that the file or a reference to the file is in the directory of the file including it.
